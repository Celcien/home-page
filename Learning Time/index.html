  <h1>Celcien's Development History</h1> 
  <p class = "sub-title">Week 2</p>
  <p>I learned more CSS information mainly with how CSS sees priority
    of classes, id's and such. Still definetly have lots to learn but this is 
    something I could see being easily learned with time using CSS, I have
    stared learning about the box model with block and inline display types and such I have made up
    a schedule to help give me focus on when I should be doing web dev and made
    this website to keep track of my progress. I hope to when I learn javascript and more stuff
    to be updating this website specifically to add more functionalily, am considering
    shifting it to something I can do daily instead of weekly but I am not sure.
    <span>What I learned:</span>enter stuff here

  <p class = "sub-title">Week 1</p>
  <p>I have started trying to learn web dev stuff I decided that I want to
    start learning web development as I see lots of jobs and freelance opportunitys
    with it much more than with java, especially now since I am going to into Information
    Systems I think that web development would be a great asset to have to add onto it.
    <span>What I learned:</span> I started out learning bash which helped me with file manipulation
    which after learning I learned a lot of base HTML and CSS information. I know about the basic makeup 
    of HTML and CSS pages made this whole website with help from the Odin Project and overall have been
    feeling pretty good about my start. I am very excited to learn JavaScript as then I can functionality
    to my website which would be great although I am very happy about the design part as I love designing things
